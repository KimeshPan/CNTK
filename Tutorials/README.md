# Tutorials

In this folder you find several tutorials both for the CNTK python API and for brain script. 

## Python

The pyhton notebooks in this folder cover a range of different application including 
image classification, language understanding, reinforcement learning and others. 
Additionally, the folder NumpyInterop contains a simple example of how to use 
numpy arrays as input for CNTK training and evaluation.

## Brain script

There are four detailed tutorials on how to use CNTK with brain script. 
A step-by-step walk through for each of these is provided on the [CNTK wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/wiki/Tutorials).

* Hello World - Logistic Regression ([Details](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/wiki/Tutorial))
* Image Hands On ([Details](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/wiki/Hands-On-Labs-Image-Recognition)) 
* SLU (Language Understanding) Hands On ([Details](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/wiki/Hands-On-Labs-Language-Understanding))
* Object detection using Fast R-CNN ([Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/tree/master/Examples/Image/Detection/FastRCNN), [Details](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/wiki/Object-Detection-using-Fast-R-CNN))
